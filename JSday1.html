    <p>Question 1 :Difference between "==" and "===" operators ?</p>
    <p>A. * "==" operator is used to see the both values<br> * "===" is used to check the datatypes and values.</p>
    <p>Question 2 : what is the spread operator ?</p>
    <pre>A.  Spread operator allows an iterable, such as an array or string, 
    to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls)
    or elements (for array literals) are expected. In an object literal,
    the spread syntax enumerates the properties of an object and adds the key-value pairs to the object being created.
        
    example : let arr=["i","am","rohit"] 
              let arr2 =["hey","hi"];
              let arr1 = [...arr,...arr2]
              console.log(arr1);</pre>
    <p>Question 3 : what are the difference between var,let and const ?</p>
    <pre>A.Var can access any variable is called as global scope.var variables can be re-declared and updated.
        example :  var tester = "hey hi";
    
        function newFunction() {
            var hello = "hello";
        }
        console.log(hello); // error: hello is not defined.

        let :let is block scoped.let can be updated but not re-declared.

        example :let greeting = "say Hi";
        if (true) {
            let greeting = "say Hello instead";
            console.log(greeting); // "say Hello instead"
        }
        console.log(greeting); // "say Hi".

        const:const declarations are block scoped.const cannot be updated or re-declared.
        example:const greeting = "say Hi";
        const greeting = "say Hello instead";// error: Identifier 'greeting' has already been declared.
    </pre>
    <p>Question 4 : what is execution context ?</p>
    <pre>A.When the JavaScript engine executes the JavaScript code, it creates execution contexts.
        Each execution context has two phases: the creation phase and the execution phase.
        The creation phase:
        When the JavaScript engine executes a script for the first time, it creates the global execution context.
        The execution phase :
        During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.
        example : var a=10;
    console.log(a); </pre>
    <p>Question 5 : what is meant by first call function ?</p>
    <pre>A. The functions in that language are treated like other variables.
        * functions can be assigned by any other varaible.
        * functions can be passed as an argument.
        * functions can be returned from another function.
        example : const greet = () => {
            console.log("hello")
        }
        greet();
    </pre>
    <p>Question 6 : what are closures?Give an example for closures.</p>
    <pre>A.Closure is a combination of inner function and lexical environment of outer function.
        example: function outer (){
            let a = 10 ;
              function inner (){
                console.log(a);
              }
              inner();
        }
        outer();
    </pre>
    <p>Question 7 : Explain call(),apply(),Bind() methods ? Give an example of call(),apply(),Bind() methods</p>
    <pre>A.These are just different way of calling or invoking a function.
        when you are calling a function using any of these then you Document
        have to define in the function that the first argument will be an object.

        example: let user1 = {
            name : 'rahul',
            age : 23,
            city :'tirupati'
        }
        let user2 = {
            name : 'Govindh',
            age : 24,
            city :'chittoor'
        }
        function Userdetail(company,designation){
            console.log(this.name + 'is' + this.age + 'years old',company," ",designation)
        }
        Userdetail.call(user1,"google","front end dev")//call:Argument will be passed individually.//
        Userdetail.apply(user2,"hcl","back end dev")//Apply : Argument will be passed in an array.//

        const newFunction = Userdetail.bind(user1);//Bind: It will return you new function,you can use it anywhere.
        newFunction("Flipkart","Full stack");
