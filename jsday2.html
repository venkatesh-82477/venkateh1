    <p>Question 1 : What is creation phase and execution phase ?</p>
    <pre>A.Creation phase : 
        The creation phase is the one in which the JS engine invokes a function but does not begin its execution.
        In this phase, the JS engine begins its compilation phase and scans the particular function code for compiling it but does not execute the code.
  Execution phase :
        During the execution phase, the JavaScript engine executes the code line by line, 
        assigns the values to variables, and executes the function calls.
    </pre>
    <P>Question 2 : What are Objects in JavaScript ?</P>
    <pre>A.Objects : In JavaScript,Object is a non-premitive datatype that allows you to store multiple collection of data
        in the form of key and value pairs.
        * There are 3 different ways of creating objects.
        1. Object literal :
        let obj = {
            name : "gokul",
            age : 25 ,
        }
        console.log(obj.name);
        
        2. Creating instance of object:
        let obj1 = new object();
        obj1.name = "rahul",
        obj1.age = 22;

        3. Object constructor :
        function obj(name,age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
        let obj2 = new obj("ravi","23");
        console.log(obj1);
    </pre>
    <p>Question 3 : What are function constructors ?</p>
    <pre>A.Function constructors : Function is said to be constructor when it is used to initialize
        and create a instance of class that is also called as "Object".
        * It is good practice to follow to keep the first letter of function name capital.
        * It used this and new keyword.

        Example : function obj(name,age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age;
        }
        let obj2 = new obj("ravi","23");
        console.log(obj1);
    </pre>
    <p>Question 4 : Explain prototypes ?</p>
    <pre>A.Prototype : Prototype is itself an object that have prototype object present inside it.
        
        Example : function Student(name,age){
            this.name = name ,
            this.age = age ,
     
        }
        Student.prototype.rollno = "25"
        let student1 =new student('guru',25,555)
        student1.rollno = "25"
        let student2 =new student('thiru',26,565);
        console.log(student1);
    </pre>
    <p>Question 5 : What is prototype chain ?</p>
    <pre>A.Prototype chain :
        Prototypes are the means of inheritance in JavaScript. The prototype of an object would also have a prototype object.
         This continues until we reach the top level when there is no prototype object.
        
         Example :function Student(name,age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age; 
        }
        const student = new Student('John',32)
        
        console.log(student)
    </pre>
    <p>Question 6 : Give an example of inheritance using function constructor.</p>
    <pre>A. inheritance is something when child is inheriting the properties of parent.
        
        Example : function Student(name,age){
            this.name = name;
            this.age = age; 
        }
        function StudentDescription (name,age,id,class){
            Student.call(this,name,age,id,class);
            this.id = id;
            this.class =class;
        }
        let Student1 = new Student("ramu",23);
        let Student2 = new StudentDescription('SOMU',24,666,"B.Tech");
        console.log(Student1);
        console.log(Student2);
    </pre>
    <p>Question 7 : What are callBacks ?</p>
    <pre>A.Function that is passed as an argument to another function is called as callBack function.
        * As JS is event driven language,which means they dont stop the program from running until they are completed.
        
        Example : function callback(callback){
            console.log('hi,I am callback function');
            callback();
        }
        function call(){
            console.log('This will printed after callback')
        }
        callback(show);
    </pre>
