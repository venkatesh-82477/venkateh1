    <p>Question 1 : How many operators do we have in JS ?</p>
    <pre>A.Operators in JS are : 1. Assignment Operators
                        2. Arithmetic Operators
                        3. Bitwise Operators
                        4. Logical Operators
                        5. Comparision Operators
                        6. Conditional Operators
    </pre>
    <p>Question 2 : What are pure functions?</p>
    <pre>A.Pure function is a function that would give same or consistent output if same input is being passed.
  It is nothing but a well defined function.

        Example : function add(a,b){
                    console.log(a+b);
                }
                add(2,2);
                add(6,6);
    </pre>
    <p>Question 3 : What is callback hell ?</p>
    <pre>A.Callback hell is a function that will be executed after execution of its parent function is executed completely.
  It is also form pyramid like structure that is difficult to understand and debug.
  * We should avoid using callback hell as much as possible.

  Example: function PrintNumbers(){
    setTimeout(()=>{
        console.log("1")
        setTimeout(()=>{
            console.log("2")
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log("3")
                setTimeout(()=>{
                    console.log("4")
                },4000)
            },3000)
        },2000)
    },1000)
}
PrintNumbers()
    </pre>
    <p>Question 4 : What are promises and why do we need them?</p>
    <pre>A.* Promises is like heaven for callback.It is introduced in ES6 version to handle assynchronous operation in an efficient way.
    * To debug and manage code we need promises.
    * Promises allows us to write cleaner code and allows error to pass down the chain and can be handled in a common place.

    Example : const PrintNumbers =(time,value)=>{
        return new Promise((resolved,rejected) => {
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log(time);
                resolved ();
            },time)
        })
    }
    PrintNumbers(4000,"5")
    .then(()=>PrintNumbers(3000,"4"))
    .then(()=>PrintNumbers(2000,"3"))
    .then(()=>PrintNumbers(1000,"2"))
    </pre>
    <p>Question 5 : What is promise chaining ?</p>
    <pre>A.Multiple use of .then method will leads to promise chaining.</pre>
    <p>Question 6 : Give an example of async/await</p>
    <pre>A.const PrintNumbers =(time,value)=>{
        return new Promise((resolved,rejected) => {
            setTimeout(()=>{
                console.log(time);
                resolved ();
            },time)
        })
    }
        async function newFunction (){
        await PrintNumbers(4000,"4")
        await PrintNumbers(3000,"3")
        await PrintNumbers(2000,"2")
        await PrintNumbers(1000,"1")
    }
    newFunction ();
    </pre>
    <p>Question 7 : What is the purpose of async/await keywords?</p>
    <p>A.We use the async keyword with a function to represent that the function is an asynchronous function. The async function returns a promise.<br>
        The await keyword is used inside the async function to wait for the asynchronous operation.
